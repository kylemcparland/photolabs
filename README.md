# ðŸ“¸ PhotoLabs - By: Kyle McParland (Lighthouse Labs 2024)

PhotoLabs is a full-stack, React-based single-page application (SPA) that enables users to dynamically explore and interact with photos. Users can sort images by topic and mark them as favourites, utilizing React's state management system. This project focuses on the front-end, client-side user experience, and integrates various technologies including React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Express.

## Installation

Clone PhotoLabs using the SSH key in the git repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kylemcparland/photolabs.git
cd photolabs
```
Next, using your RDBMS of choice (postgreSQL in my case), initialize the local database using `create.sql`. Populate the database using `development.sql`.
```
backend/src/db/schema/create.sql
backend/src/db/schema/development.sql
...
ALTERNATIVELY: Use the browser to navigate to `http://localhost:8001/api/debug/reset`
```

Finally, install dependencies with `npm install` in each respective `/frontend` and `/backend` directory.

## How to use

1. Start the back-end server:
```sh
cd backend
npm start
...
"Listening on port 8001 in development mode."
```
2. Start the front-end application. The app will be served at port 3000 by default:

```sh
cd frontend
npm start
...
"Compiled successfully!"
```
Connect locally using the url http://localhost:3000/ in your browser!
